## NHANES Obesity Predictor (in progress)

Obesity has become an epidemic in the United States of America. Environmental factors contribute to the development of obesity but some people are more prone to it than others. The question was asked about whether there are physiological markers and labs that could be taken to potentially predict the development of obesity. 

The project draws public data from NHANES Website and the data from the years 2017-2020 is used. The data was first extracted and cleaned. Relational database was created locally to host the dataset. The next step will be to find correlations and make a prediction model.

### Various Factos Affecting the Number of Total COVID-19 Cases
COVID-19 pandemic spread quickly and so were the responses from various countries. Given the dataset from Tech Academy, various analyses were performed to see which factors were correlated to the increase in total cases. One of the factors that was analyzed was whether smokers were more likely to contract COVID-19 infection compared to non smokers. There was a weak positive correlation in female smoker population and the number of COVID-19 cases in that population.
