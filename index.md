## OHIP-14 Analysis on Orthognathic Surgical Patients
Orthognathic surgery is a corrective procedure used to address skeletal and dental deformities that affect jaw alignment, facial symmetry, and oral function. While the clinical benefits of surgery are well-documented, its impact on patients' oral health–related quality of life (OHRQoL) is equally important to understand.

To evaluate this, I analyzed patient responses to the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14), a validated, patient-reported outcome measure that captures the social and psychological effects of oral health conditions across seven domains—including functional limitation, physical pain, and social disability.

This project aimed to:

- Assess whether OHIP-14 total scores significantly improve from baseline (preoperative) to postoperative follow-ups
<br>
- Compare OHIP-14 scores at 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery
<br>
- Identify which OHIP domains contribute most to overall changes in quality of life
<br>

The analysis showed a significant improvement in OHRQoL following surgery, with the most notable gains occurring by postoperative month 3. These findings can help set realistic recovery expectations for patients and inform research protocols by highlighting the value of data collection at both early and later postoperative time points (e.g., 3, 6, and 12 months).

The details of the project, code, and the background information is included in the Jupyter Notebook (<a href="https://github.com/eudorach/ds_codesummary/blob/main/OHIP_Analysis/Longitudinal%20Analysis%20of%20OHIP.ipynb">See Code</a>).

### Various Factos Affecting the Number of Total COVID-19 Cases
COVID-19 pandemic spread quickly and so were the responses from various countries. Given the dataset from Tech Academy, various analyses were performed to see which factors were correlated to the increase in total cases. One of the factors that was analyzed was whether smokers were more likely to contract COVID-19 infection compared to non smokers. There was a weak positive correlation in female smoker population and the number of COVID-19 cases in that population.

## Google Playstore

### Analysis of Popular Genre and Category
There are many applications in Google Play Store. An analysis was performed to see which type of application would be the most successful for creation. The conclusion was that the rating 'Everyone 10+' was the most utilized, thus is most likely to succeed.

## Epworth Sleepiness Analysis on Orthognathic Surgical Patients
Orthognathic surgery patients can experience reduced sleep quality due to difficulty breathing/snoring. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores did not have significant changes between preoperative and postoperative time points. It is difficult to assess the quality of breathing through quality of sleep.
