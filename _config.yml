  I’m a Surgical PA with 4+ years of experience in the OR and inpatient settings, along with nearly 2 years in clinical research. Over time, I’ve become increasingly drawn to the intersection of medicine and data — how clinical insights can be better understood, predicted, and improved through data analytics.
  I’m now transitioning toward a career in clinical data analysis, combining hands-on healthcare experience with a growing skill set in data interpretation, research, and evidence-based decision-making.
